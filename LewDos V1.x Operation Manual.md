### 1.1.1 Modularity
LewDos is made to be really modular for the purpose of compatibility. LewDos is expected to run on many systems, with various capabilites. The minimal configuration of LewDos only requires a way for User input and user output in form of a terminal. this could be a serial port, but also just a screen with keyboard. if you then wish to expand your capabilities, there are Exapnsion Modules (.Ldmod)
